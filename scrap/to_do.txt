stretch ideas
    better front end?

	something agentic that creates a page or analysis or view based on user input
        user input to issue
        issue to code
        test code
        pull request
        hitl
        maybe memory

	email feedback

	news letter

    create MCP
	existing analysis tools or frameworks
		connect to existing or external MCP

    using google maps API to pull in more information on the incident sites and surrounding areas

    meta analysis of fault
        differing LLM versions and fault explanations
