# rough notes on possible directions to take this mini project

Working

    try claude code and git trees
        https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/common-workflows
        git worktree add ../project-feature-a -b feature-a
        git worktree add ../AVIRD_frontend-prior-pages -b prior-pages

        how do I work this back into the main git?	

To do
    more basic webpages
        entities
        contact
        incident

    deply prototype

    then the agents
        fault


stretch
    waymo data
    regular pull and update (avird backend)

Backlog
	protopype local works with postgres


Ideas
    use the pdf and data explnation summaries for context


MVP website

    DONE one time load
        NHTSA data set
        waymo dataset
        initialize the DB
        postgress

    Prototype website that display one page
        thinking Heroku

    something agentic
        feedback into issue
        issue comes with plan

    my basic ideas
        use git trees for this
        see the other pages
        my waymo plus data on to the pages

    doing a regular cronjob pull
        own repo


stretch ideas
    better front end?

	something agentic that creates a page or analysis or view based on user input
        user input to issue
        issue to code
        test code
        pull request
        hitl
        maybe memory

	email feedback

	news letter

    create MCP
	existing analysis tools or frameworks
		connect to existing or external MCP
